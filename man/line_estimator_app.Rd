\description{
The function line_estimator_app() takes several arguments: object (default = NULL) is an image data frame in long format with columns x, y, and hexacode for color; path is the path to an image, and can be used instead of the object; grid_number decides the vertical lines (horisontal lines are separated by the same distance as the x-axis lines and might differ from the grid_number); and finally seed makes the random initialisation of the gridlines a bit less random.
Rules of the line estimator:
- One must always assign two points to one air bubble.
- If one misses a point, then assign a new point on top (it is not possible to remove points).
- Always make sure lines are completed before using the estimates.
- Alternate between completing horisontal and vertical lines to reduce potential bias and obtain a better estimate.
